//You are given two strings word1 and word2.
//Merge the strings by adding letters in alternating order, starting with word1.
//If a string is longer than the other, append the additional letters onto the end of the merged string.
//Return the merged string.

//Example 1:
//Input: word1 = "abc", word2 = "pqr"
//Output: "apbqcr"
	
//Example 2:
//Input: word1 = "ab", word2 = "pqrs"
//Output: "apbqrs"
			
//Example 3:
//Input: word1 = "abcd", word2 = "pq"
//Output: "apbqcd"
